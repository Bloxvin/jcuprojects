You need to determine if a user can join our secret society, Pythonistocrats. To qualify,a user must be 18+ years of age and have made at least as many mistakes as their age. Qualifying users should be told, "Welcome :)", but those who don't qualify should be told, "Denied :(".


Pseudocode 
============
get age
get mistakes

if mistakes >= age
	print Welcome :)
else
	print Denied :(


age = int(input("Age: ")
mistakes = int(input("Mistakes: ")

if mistakes >= age:
	print("Welcome :\)")
else
	print("Denied :\(")


Write Python code for this simple menu-style problem

Ask the user fofr their age and a choice, then display result
a) multiply age by 2
b) add 10 to age
c) halve age
anything else, print no


Pseudocode 

get age
get choice

if choice == 1:
	print age*2
else if choice == 2:
	print age+10
else if choice == 3:
	print age/2
else
	print "no"


age = int(input("Age: "))
choice = int(input("Choose one of these \n\tmultiply age by 2\n\tadd 10 to age\n\thalve age\n\nChoice: ")

if choice == "a":
	print age*2
elif choice == "b":
	print age+10
elif choice == "c":
	print age/2
else
	print("NO")
